# Biography

I am a PhD student in the [Carbonshed lab] (http://diegori.web.unc.edu/) at the University of North Carolina - Chapel Hill working
under the advisement of Dr. Diego Riveros-Iregui. My research interests focus on surface-groundwater interactions
and vulnerability to human health from various sources of contamination. I am currently researching carbon flux
rates from freshwater streams and rivers to the atmosphere. I am also researching potential vulnerability of private water well
systems to contamination from hydraulic fracturing activities accross the United States.
