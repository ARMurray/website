<p>Check out our work on Carbon Flux in North Carolina freshwater streams. We are using an <a href="http://www.eosense.com/products/eosfd/">eosense carbon flux sensor</a> alongside four Vaisala GMP222 CO2 Sensors to understand the rates at which Carbon leaves freshwater systems in a variety of discharge scenarios. Sensor testing is now complete for the eosense carbon flux sensor, as well as our CO2 Soil Sensors. We are currently preparing the instruments for field deployment (Hopefully mid to late October). Be sure to check out the <a href="https://amurraygeo.com/project/carbon-flux/">living document</a> where I will be updating the progress of this research.</p>
