      <description>Formatting CO2 Data for Use in R  In this post I will describe my workflow for formatting CO2 Data for use within R statistical software. CO2 data was collected using two sensors, a Vaisalla GNP-222 and and eosense eosFD Soil CO2 Flux Sensor. While these are the sensors I use, the workflow should be similar regardless of the sensor. The Vaisala collects CO2 readings only. The eosense collects CO2, CO2 Flux, and temperature.</description>

      <description>Check out our work on Carbon Flux in North Carolina freshwater streams. We are using an eosense carbon flux sensor alongside four Vaisala GMP222 CO2 Sensors to understand the rates at which Carbon leaves freshwater systems in a variety of discharge scenarios. Sensor testing is now complete for the eosense carbon flux sensor, as well as our CO2 Soil Sensors. We are currently preparing the instruments for field deployment (Hopefully mid to late October).</description>

      <description>What is Carbon Flux? When we refer to the carbon cycle, we are talking about how carbon moves through the different parts of the earth system. Carbon can be transported to and from different parts of the earth system in several different ways such as the burning of fossil fuels, plant respiration, photosynthesis, and soil decomposition to name a few. When we talk about carbon flux we are talking about understanding how much carbon moves between sources and sinks.</description>
