A key resource in the U.S. was the 1990 Census where the source of domestic drinking water was a survey question. Two methods are developed to update estimates of the areal density of well use using readily accessible data. The first uses well logs reported to the states and the addition of housing units reported to the Census Bureau at the county, census tract and census block group scales. The second uses housing units reported to the Census and an estimated well use fraction. To limit the scope and because of abundant data, Oklahoma was used for a pilot project. The resulting well density estimates were consistent among spatial scales, and were statistically similar. High rates of well use were identified to the north and east of Oklahoma City, primarily in expanding cities located over a productive aquifer. In contrast, low rates of well use were identified in rural areas without public water systems and in Oklahoma's second largest city, Tulsa, each attributable to lack of suitable ground water. High densities of well use may be expected in rural areas without public water systems, expanding cities and suburbs, and legacy areas of well usage. The completeness of reported well logs was tested by counts from neighborhoods with known reliance on wells which showed reporting rates of 20% to 98%. Well densities in these neighborhoods were higher than the larger-scale estimates indicating that locally high densities typically exist within analysis units. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to determine that 27% of underground storage tanks that had at least one well within a typical distance of concern of 300 m (1000 ft).","tags":[],"title":"Estimation of the proximity of private domestic wells to underground storage tanks: Oklahoma pilot study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Beck","Shengan Zhan","Hongxing Liu","Susanna Tong","Bo Yang","Min Xu","Zhaoxia Ye","Yan Huang","Song Shu","Qiusheng Wu","Shujie Wang","Kevin Berling","Andrew Murray","Erich Emery","Molly Reif","Joseph Harwood","Jade Young","Christopher Nietch","Dana Macke","Mark Martin","Garrett Stillings","Richard Stump","Haibin Suh"],"categories":null,"content":"#More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1493784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493784000,"objectID":"1eb02bb373d07170b03095890b728826","permalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","publishdate":"2017-05-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We compared 10 established and 2 new satellite reflectance algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in a temperate reservoir in southwest Ohio using coincident hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident surface observations collected within 1 h of image acquisition to develop simple proxies for algal blooms in water bodies sensitive to algal blooms (especially toxic or harmful algal blooms (HABs)) and to facilitate portability between multispectral satellite imagers for regional algal bloom monitoring.
