The casing failure rate of unconventional wells has been investigated in various studies and shown to range between 1.9% and 6.3%. The casing and/or cement failure rate of unconventional wells versus conventional wells is shown to be 6-fold higher in Pennsylvania’s Marcellus Shale play, for example. In the United States, 17% of the population obtains their domestic water supply from privately owned groundwater wells. These wells are unregulated by the Safe Drinking Water Act and therefore are not subject to water quality testing. While the locations of hydraulic fracturing wells are well-known, estimates of private well locations by census block were only recently developed. I present a sensitivity analysis using the range of identified casing failure rates to quantify the number of domestic wells potentially at risk of contamination from methane migration from unconventional shale gas development. To estimate exact well locations from census block aggregations , a Monte Carlo simulation is used to approximate the likelihood of specific well locations within a 1 km radius of a well pad. Using lower and upper bounds of failure rates combined with a national database of unconventional gas well operations, potential impacts are quantified and shown as geographical hot spots to identify areas of possible concern relating to the contamination of domestic water supplies.","tags":[],"title":"AGU Poster","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1536939540,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1536939540,"objectID":"33eb8cdb586aab9ff5c7fe34116a4a3a","permalink":"/project/dealmein/","publishdate":"2018-09-14T11:39:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/project/dealmein/","section":"project","summary":"Deal Me In is a web application under active development.

Overview The purpose of this paper is to identify populations vulnerable to impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities, specifically based on their usage of privately owned domestic water wells. This is a living document to maintain the reproducibility and transparency of this research while also serving as an aid for others interested in doing similar work.\n  Data Preparation Libraries First we’ll load the packages we need for our analysis:\nlibrary(sf) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2)  Read in the Data Next, we’ll read in the data. Our data here is all in the NAD83 coordinate system and is unprojected, so we use the crs ‘4269’ which is NAD83 and import the shapefiles and csv and create sf objects. Then we project all of the data to UTM zone 17N which encompasses eastern Ohio.\nblocks \u0026lt;- st_read(\u0026#39;Blocks_5mi_Utica_NAD83.shp\u0026#39;, crs = 4269) blocks_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(blocks, 2958) Wells \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#39;Downloaded/Utica_092218.csv\u0026#39;) Wells_sf \u0026lt;- st_as_sf(Wells, coords = c(\u0026quot;Surf_Lon\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Surf_Lat\u0026quot;), crs = 4269) Wells_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(Wells_sf, 2958) counties \u0026lt;- st_read(\u0026#39;counties_NAD83.shp\u0026#39;, crs = 4269) counties_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(counties, 2958)  Setting Up Data to Plot We need to create centroids from the county layer so that we can use them to add text labels to the map. We do this by getting the coordinates of the centroids using st_centroid and then separating the x and y coordinates and putting them into a new sf object. Also here, we create a new object that gets the bounding box of the oil/gas wells. We’ll use this to create the extent of our map (so it is zoomed in to the right place). Finally we create a color palette which we use to symbolize the wells in the map.\ncentroids \u0026lt;- st_centroid(counties_prj) centroids_xy \u0026lt;- st_coordinates(centroids) centroids$X \u0026lt;- centroids_xy[,1] centroids$Y \u0026lt;- centroids_xy[,2] bbox \u0026lt;- st_bbox(Wells_prj) well_palette \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;#FF8500\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#FFE600\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#65E809\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#E81903\u0026quot;)  Making Our First Plot The code chunk below plots the map below which displays oil and gas well data obtained from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. These are wells drilled into the Utica Shale and are color coded by their status (as of September 22, 2018). Using the ggplot and sf packages, the data includes wells and U.S. counties, both projected in UTM 17N. The last line of code sets the coordinate limits of the map based on the well data.\nggplot() + geom_sf(data = counties_prj)+ geom_sf(data = Wells_prj, aes(colour=Status, fill = Status))+ scale_fill_manual(values = well_palette) + scale_color_manual(values = well_palette)+ geom_text(data = centroids, aes(x = X, y = Y, label = NAME10),size = 2.5)+ xlim(as.integer(bbox$xmin), as.integer(bbox$xmax)) + ylim(as.integer(bbox$ymin), as.integer(bbox$ymax))   Geometries and Thresholds The focus of this research is identifying domestic wells that are at potential risk of contamination from methane migration through the ground.We are working with different geographies, mainly Census Blocks and Buffered areas around oil and gas wells. Since the buffers slice through the Census areas, we’ll need to estimate the number of people that live within each Census block and also live within the buffer of the oil/gas well. To accomplish this, we will use the sf package and the intersect function to create new geometries of Census blocks within buffers.\nThis is the end of the document for now, please check back soon to see the progress!

A key resource in the U.S. was the 1990 Census where the source of domestic drinking water was a survey question. Two methods are developed to update estimates of the areal density of well use using readily accessible data. The first uses well logs reported to the states and the addition of housing units reported to the Census Bureau at the county, census tract and census block group scales. The second uses housing units reported to the Census and an estimated well use fraction. To limit the scope and because of abundant data, Oklahoma was used for a pilot project. The resulting well density estimates were consistent among spatial scales, and were statistically similar. High rates of well use were identified to the north and east of Oklahoma City, primarily in expanding cities located over a productive aquifer. In contrast, low rates of well use were identified in rural areas without public water systems and in Oklahoma's second largest city, Tulsa, each attributable to lack of suitable ground water. High densities of well use may be expected in rural areas without public water systems, expanding cities and suburbs, and legacy areas of well usage. The completeness of reported well logs was tested by counts from neighborhoods with known reliance on wells which showed reporting rates of 20% to 98%. Well densities in these neighborhoods were higher than the larger-scale estimates indicating that locally high densities typically exist within analysis units. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to determine that 27% of underground storage tanks that had at least one well within a typical distance of concern of 300 m (1000 ft).","tags":[],"title":"Estimation of the proximity of private domestic wells to underground storage tanks: Oklahoma pilot study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Beck","Shengan Zhan","Hongxing Liu","Susanna Tong","Bo Yang","Min Xu","Zhaoxia Ye","Yan Huang","Song Shu","Qiusheng Wu","Shujie Wang","Kevin Berling","Andrew Murray","Erich Emery","Molly Reif","Joseph Harwood","Jade Young","Christopher Nietch","Dana Macke","Mark Martin","Garrett Stillings","Richard Stump","Haibin Suh"],"categories":null,"content":"#More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1493784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493784000,"objectID":"1eb02bb373d07170b03095890b728826","permalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","publishdate":"2017-05-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We compared 10 established and 2 new satellite reflectance algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in a temperate reservoir in southwest Ohio using coincident hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident surface observations collected within 1 h of image acquisition to develop simple proxies for algal blooms in water bodies sensitive to algal blooms (especially toxic or harmful algal blooms (HABs)) and to facilitate portability between multispectral satellite imagers for regional algal bloom monitoring.

When we refer to the carbon cycle, we are talking about how carbon moves through the different parts of the earth system. Carbon can be transported to and from different parts of the earth system in several different ways such as the burning of fossil fuels, plant respiration, photosynthesis, and soil decomposition to name a few. When we talk about carbon flux we are talking about understanding how much carbon moves between sources and sinks. In this case, we are talking about the flux rate of carbon from water to the atmosphere. We know that when water flows through streams and rivers, it releases carbon into the atmosphere but there is a lot about this that we do not yet understand. For example, we do not know exactly how much carbon is released from flowing rivers and streams. We also do not know if the rate of carbon flux significantly changes depending on the speed or discharge of the river or stream. Our project, which you can read about below, is focused on trying to understand and describe these dynamics within streams and rivers so that we may establish a more detailed knowledge about the global carbon cycle and the rates of carbon moving into the atmosphere from freshwater.\n  Flux From North Carolina Streams So, now that we have laid out what we don’t know, we can move on to how we plan to learn about it. Our research aims to understand how carbon flux from freshwater streams to the atmosphere varies depending on variables such as discharge, stream slope, and land use. Our approach is to use two seperate methods by which we can determine how much carbon is leaving a stream over a given amount of time. The first method uses a sensor capable of directly measuring carbon flux. This sensor is designed to measure flux from soil to the atmosphere but we have built a platform for it to be used in a stream. The second method involves using four CO2 sensors which will be spaced out within the stream and submerged underwater. By measuring the decline in CO2 over a known distance within the stream, we should be able to determine CO2 loss to the atmosphere. For both of these methods, we will artificially inject the dstream with CO2 upstream of the sensors. This will allow us to play with changes in CO2 concentrations and the effects on rates and also to negate any small impacts from sediment / plsnt uptake (plants and sediments within the stream can absorb CO2, though the amount of CO2 that would be absorbed relative to the amount of CO2 in the stream would be very small.)\nThe Instruments We are using a soil CO2 Flux Sensor from eosense in a floating apparatus, custom built to allow for CO2 flux measurements to be taken from a flowing stream. In addition we are using four Vaisala GM222 CO2 sensors to establish in-stream CO2 levels. Using a method published by Johnson et al.(2009) the CO2 sensors are wrapped in special PTFE tubing which allows for the sensor to effectively measure CO2 concentrations without letting water through which could destroy the sensor.\n Instrument Testing CO2 Measurements from two Vaisala sensors, as well as the eosense flux sensor(red). These tests were taken in our lab with all three sensors directly next to eachother on a table top for the sole purpose of making sure they worked and the data could be handled and visualized.\n The blue line represents direct flux readings from the eosense sensor. As expected, there isn’t much of anything occuring as we are not measuring one-way movement (for example: soil to air or water to air)\n Citations:\n1.
