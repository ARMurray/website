This is a living document of my research investigating the potential risk to private wells from contamination relating to fracking throughout the United States. The goal of this document is for it to be submitted as a manuscript once it is completed.\nThis is the working file for my hydraulic fracturing impact analysis paper. Upon it’s completion you will find it posted here  Overview The purpose of this paper is to identify populations vulnerable to impacts from hydraulic fracturing activities, specifically based on their usage of privately owned domestic water wells. This is a living document to maintain the reproducibility and transparency of this research while also serving as an aid for others interested in doing similar work.\n  Data Preparation Libraries First we’ll load the packages we need for our analysis:\nlibrary(sf) library(dplyr) library(ggplot2)  Read in the Data Next, we’ll read in the data. Our data here is all in the NAD83 coordinate system and is unprojected, so we use the crs ‘4269’ which is NAD83 and import the shapefiles and csv and create sf objects. Then we project all of the data to UTM zone 17N which encompasses eastern Ohio.\nblocks \u0026lt;- st_read(\u0026#39;Blocks_5mi_Utica_NAD83.shp\u0026#39;, crs = 4269) blocks_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(blocks, 2958) Wells \u0026lt;- read.csv(\u0026#39;Downloaded/Utica_092218.csv\u0026#39;) Wells_sf \u0026lt;- st_as_sf(Wells, coords = c(\u0026quot;Surf_Lon\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;Surf_Lat\u0026quot;), crs = 4269) Wells_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(Wells_sf, 2958) counties \u0026lt;- st_read(\u0026#39;counties_NAD83.shp\u0026#39;, crs = 4269) counties_prj \u0026lt;- st_transform(counties, 2958)  Setting Up Data to Plot We need to create centroids from the county layer so that we can use them to add text labels to the map. We do this by getting the coordinates of the centroids using st_centroid and then separating the x and y coordinates and putting them into a new sf object. Also here, we create a new object that gets the bounding box of the oil/gas wells. We’ll use this to create the extent of our map (so it is zoomed in to the right place). Finally we create a color palette which we use to symbolize the wells in the map.\ncentroids \u0026lt;- st_centroid(counties_prj) centroids_xy \u0026lt;- st_coordinates(centroids) centroids$X \u0026lt;- centroids_xy[,1] centroids$Y \u0026lt;- centroids_xy[,2] bbox \u0026lt;- st_bbox(Wells_prj) well_palette \u0026lt;- c(\u0026quot;#FF8500\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#FFE600\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#65E809\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;#E81903\u0026quot;)  Making Our First Plot The code chunk below plots the map below which displays oil and gas well data obtained from the Ohio Department of Natural Resources. These are wells drilled into the Utica Shale and are color coded by their status (as of September 22, 2018). Using the ggplot and sf packages, the data includes wells and U.S. counties, both projected in UTM 17N. The last line of code sets the coordinate limits of the map based on the well data.\nggplot() + geom_sf(data = counties_prj)+ geom_sf(data = Wells_prj, aes(colour=Status, fill = Status))+ scale_fill_manual(values = well_palette) + scale_color_manual(values = well_palette)+ geom_text(data = centroids, aes(x = X, y = Y, label = NAME10),size = 2.5)+ xlim(as.integer(bbox$xmin), as.integer(bbox$xmax)) + ylim(as.integer(bbox$ymin), as.integer(bbox$ymax))   Geometries and Thresholds The focus of this research is identifying domestic wells that are at potential risk of contamination from methane migration through the ground.We are working with different geographies, mainly Census Blocks and Buffered areas around oil and gas wells. Since the buffers slice through the Census areas, we’ll need to estimate the number of people that live within each Census block and also live within the buffer of the oil/gas well. To accomplish this, we will use the sf package and the intersect function to create new geometries of Census blocks within buffers.\n  This is the end of the document for now, please check back soon to see the progress!

A key resource in the U.S. was the 1990 Census where the source of domestic drinking water was a survey question. Two methods are developed to update estimates of the areal density of well use using readily accessible data. The first uses well logs reported to the states and the addition of housing units reported to the Census Bureau at the county, census tract and census block group scales. The second uses housing units reported to the Census and an estimated well use fraction. To limit the scope and because of abundant data, Oklahoma was used for a pilot project. The resulting well density estimates were consistent among spatial scales, and were statistically similar. High rates of well use were identified to the north and east of Oklahoma City, primarily in expanding cities located over a productive aquifer. In contrast, low rates of well use were identified in rural areas without public water systems and in Oklahoma's second largest city, Tulsa, each attributable to lack of suitable ground water. High densities of well use may be expected in rural areas without public water systems, expanding cities and suburbs, and legacy areas of well usage. The completeness of reported well logs was tested by counts from neighborhoods with known reliance on wells which showed reporting rates of 20% to 98%. Well densities in these neighborhoods were higher than the larger-scale estimates indicating that locally high densities typically exist within analysis units. A Monte Carlo procedure was used to determine that 27% of underground storage tanks that had at least one well within a typical distance of concern of 300 m (1000 ft).","tags":[],"title":"Estimation of the proximity of private domestic wells to underground storage tanks: Oklahoma pilot study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Richard Beck","Shengan Zhan","Hongxing Liu","Susanna Tong","Bo Yang","Min Xu","Zhaoxia Ye","Yan Huang","Song Shu","Qiusheng Wu","Shujie Wang","Kevin Berling","Andrew Murray","Erich Emery","Molly Reif","Joseph Harwood","Jade Young","Christopher Nietch","Dana Macke","Mark Martin","Garrett Stillings","Richard Stump","Haibin Suh"],"categories":null,"content":"#More detail can easily be written here using Markdown and $\\rm \\LaTeX$ math code.\n","date":1493784000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493784000,"objectID":"1eb02bb373d07170b03095890b728826","permalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","publishdate":"2017-05-03T00:00:00-04:00","relpermalink":"/publication/beck_2017/","section":"publication","summary":"We compared 10 established and 2 new satellite reflectance algorithms for estimating chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) in a temperate reservoir in southwest Ohio using coincident hyperspectral aircraft imagery and dense coincident surface observations collected within 1 h of image acquisition to develop simple proxies for algal blooms in water bodies sensitive to algal blooms (especially toxic or harmful algal blooms (HABs)) and to facilitate portability between multispectral satellite imagers for regional algal bloom monitoring.
