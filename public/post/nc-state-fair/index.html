<h2>NC State Fair Attendance</h2>
<p>
Check out this interactive plot on NC State Fair Attendance by day of the fair and colored by year. I have been playing around with plotly visualizations and in the spirit of the North Carolina State Fair, wanted to show how the attendance changes by day of the fair and through the years.

<h2>Code:</h2>
<p>I use the tidyr package to manipulate the data into a long format, the ggplot2 package to create a plot, and the plotly package to make the plot interactive. The scales package is there to let me use labels = comma which puts thousands seperators into the y-axis so it’s unnecesarry but it looks better.</p>
