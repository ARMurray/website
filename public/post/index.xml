      <title>Formatting eosense &amp; Vaisala data with R</title>

      <description>Formatting CO2 Data for Use in R  In this post I will describe my workflow for formatting CO2 Data for use within R statistical software. CO2 data was collected using two sensors, a Vaisalla GNP-222 and and eosense eosFD Soil CO2 Flux Sensor. While these are the sensors I use, the workflow should be similar regardless of the sensor. The Vaisala collects CO2 readings only. The eosense collects CO2, CO2 Flux, and temperature.</description>

      <description>NC State Fair Attendance  Check out this interactive plot on NC State Fair Attendance by day of the fair and colored by year. I have been playing around with plotly visualizations and in the spirit of the North Carolina State Fair, wanted to show how the attendance changes by day of the fair and through the years. The code I used to create this plot can be found below.</description>

      <description>Check out our work on Carbon Flux in North Carolina freshwater streams. We are using an eosense carbon flux sensor alongside four Vaisala GMP222 CO2 Sensors to understand the rates at which Carbon leaves freshwater systems in a variety of discharge scenarios. Sensor testing is now complete for the eosense carbon flux sensor, as well as our CO2 Soil Sensors. We are currently preparing the instruments for field deployment (Hopefully mid to late October).</description>

      <title>Vulnerability to Domestic Wells from Hydraulic Fracturing</title>

      <description>Update Follow along with my research on understanding domestic wells at risk to effects from methane migration stemming from hydraulic fracturing activity. This living document is being created in the spirit of open and reproducible research. Most of the analysis is done with the R statistical language and is presented exactly as executed. All of the data is free and publicly accessible. This will allow others to reproduce everything exactly, or plug in their own data.</description>
